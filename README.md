Reflection on DriverPass Projects

Project Summary
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client requested a system that combined online learning with practical, in-car instruction. The system needed to provide students with study materials, practice tests, and scheduling capabilities for behind-the-wheel lessons. Additionally, the client wanted administrative tools for managing users, monitoring student progress, and maintaining course materials.

What I Did Well
I think I did particularly well at translating the client’s needs into clear and structured requirements. By breaking the system down into functional and non-functional requirements, I ensured that both the technical aspects and the user experience were considered. I also feel confident about how I documented the design in a way that would make sense for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

What I Would Revise
If I had the chance to revise one part of my work, I would refine the system diagrams to make them more detailed and visually clear. Some diagrams could benefit from more consistent notation and clearer labeling to make them easier to interpret at a glance. Improving this area would strengthen communication between developers and the client.

Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing the client’s goals and translating them into system features. For example, the need for students to practice at their own pace was reflected in the inclusion of online practice tests and progress tracking. The need for flexibility was addressed through lesson scheduling features. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because the success of a system depends on whether it is practical and useful to those who rely on it. A system that doesn’t prioritize the end user will likely fail, no matter how technically strong it is.

Approach to System Design
When approaching software design, I start with gathering and clarifying requirements, then move into modeling the system with diagrams and structured documentation. I rely on techniques like use cases, UML diagrams, and requirements traceability to ensure all client needs are captured. In the future, I plan to use more iterative design strategies, such as prototyping and user feedback loops, to validate that my design choices align with user expectations early in the process. This approach helps minimize rework and ensures the final product truly serves its purpose.
